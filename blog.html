          1. What are the diference between map, filter, forEach, find method?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Ans : The map() method is used to create a new array by applying a
          function to each element of the original array. The new array has the
          same length as the original array, and it contains the results of the
          applied function.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
          The filter() method is used to create a new array that contains only
          the elements of the original array that pass a condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The forEach() method is used to execute a provided function once for
          each element of the array. It does not return a new array.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
          The find() method is used to return the first element in the array
          that pass a condition. It returns undefined if no such element is
          found.

          2. What are the difference between localStorage, sessionStorage and
          cookie?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Ans : localStorage and sessionStorage stores data in key-value formate
          in the user's browser. On the otherhand Cookies are small text files
          that are stored in a user's browser by a website. localStorage is
          designed for long term storage and it won't be delete untill we delete
          in manually. sessionStorage is designed for short term storage and is
          will be delete if we close the browser. Cookies are designed to store
          small amounts of data that can be sent back to a website with each
          request and it has an expiration date.

        <p>
          Ans : The event loop in JavaScript allows non-blocking I/O operations
          and asynchronous programming. It maintains a list of functions being
          executed, and when an asynchronous call completes, the corresponding
          callback function is added to a message queue. The event loop
          continuously checks the message queue and executes the corresponding
          function, resulting in a more efficient application. It's important to
          be aware of potential issues such as race conditions and use
          appropriate techniques like Promises and async/await.

        </h3>
        <p>
          Ans : The quizTimer() function has a parameter called dismis. When the
          function will call without any argument then it will start a count
          down and if the time is upper than 60 second and also devided by 2
          then the color of the time will be deep red if can't devided by 2 it's
          color will be light red. When the function will call with a truthy
          argument then it will stop the count down.

        </h3>
        <p>
          Ans : The chooseQuiz function takes two parameters: index and
          givenAns. It checks if answers array has an object with same id as the
          quiz at the given index in quizData. If yes, updates the givenAns
          property with new value. If not, adds a new object with updated
          givenAns value to answers. Finally, displayAnswers function is called
          to update the UI.
